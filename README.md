MVC vs MVP vs MVVM.

A coding exercise to create the same UI functionality with different architectures.

The same data/screen layout is presented using the following architectures:

1. MVC ('Out of the box') Android configuration
2. MVP 
3. MVP using Jake Wharton's PublishRelay as Rx bus
4. MVVM using Data Binding

Also utilized Dagger2.

TODO - Expand on Espresso/Mockito testing.
